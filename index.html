                This section describes how to migrate the NetView program to run as a production system if you are migrating from the Tivoli NetView for OS/390®V1R4.The migration information is based on the NetView components included with the initial release of V1R4.Review your maintenance to see if you have already made some of the changes that are described in this chapter.<br><br>
                You can either add the V6R3 content in to your V1R4 NetView definitions,or add your V1R4 customization to the default V6R3 members supplied with the NetView program. Either way, place the customized member into an appropriate user-allocated data set such as NETVIEW.V6R3USER.CNM01.DSIPARM.<br> DonotcustomizemembersintheSMP/E-manageddatasetssuchasNETVIEW.V6R3M0.DSIPARM.<br><br>
                Several factors can influence the method you use when migrating your NetViewdefinition members.Factors such as the size and complexity of your network, security policies that must be followed, and established practice swith in your business can all influence what is the best method for your migration.The checklist that follows details the documented method of migration as outlined in this book and supported by other books in the NetView library.Choose the method of migration that is best for you.
                Perform the following steps to migrate your V1R4 definitions:<br>
                1.	All ocateanewset of V6R3 user data sets by running sample job CNMSJ002.You needed to have done this when you completed the steps in Table12 on page16.<br>
                2.	Run the CNMSJMIG sample job to convert statements in various members in your V1R4DSIPARM dataset to the new CNMSTYLE format. See Appendix F, “Migrating to the CNMSTYLE and CNMCMDMembers,”onpage161formoredetails.<br>
                3.	Run the CNMSJMIG sample job to convert the statements in your V1R4DSICMD member to the newstatement format in the CNMCMD member. See Appendix F, “Migrating to the CNMSTYLE andCNMCMDMembers,”onpage161formoredetails.<br>
                4.	Define a unique & NV2I value (xx) for each Net View domain.<br>
                5.	If you ran the CNMSJMIG job, move any domain-specific statements that were created from the CNMSTUSR member in to the CxxSTGEN member,where xx is the value of the local symbolic variable & NV2I that you defined in the previous step.<br>
                6.	Review your customized V1R4 copy of the CNMSTYLE member. Move all of your domain-specific customization of V1R4CNMSTYLE statements in to the CxxSTGEN member and all of your system-wide customization of V1R4CNMSTYLE statements in to the CNMSTUSR member,noting that some of these changes might have been added by the CNMSJMIG job. Do not copy your V1R4 CNMSTYLE member in to the V6R3 user DSIPARM dataset.<br>
                7.	Review the CNM STYLE information in this section and the V6R3CNMSTNXT membership ped with the NetView program. Place any domain-specific customization of CNMSTYLE statements into the CxxSTGEN member and any system-wide customization of CNMSTYLE statements in to the CNMSTUSR member.Do not modify the V6R3 default CNMSTYLE member.<br>
                8.	Review there maining information in this chapter,and migrate your V1R4 NetView definition members and JCL procedures as appropriate, placing only those members that were modified into the V6R3 user datasets.<br><br>
                Figure1 on page24 shows the initialization flow for NetView V1R4,and Figure2 on page24 shows the NetView V6R3 initialization flow.Keep  this new initialization flow in mind as you make changes to your DSIPARM members.<br>

            <p>Migrating to the Graphical Enter prise NetView program does not requirey out or unany of the graphical functions. However,there might be some additional installation steps that are required to activate the Graphical Enterprise option of NetView. You can skip certain installation steps that are marked as only applying to a graphical function that you do not want to activate. However, keep in mind that if at some point you decide to activate a graphical function, these installation steps need to be revisited to ensure that all of then ecessary setup is complete.<br><br>
                Table13 on page25 lists functions that we reavailable with the V1R4 Graphical Enterprise option that are now available to you with the NetView V6R3 program.<br><br>

            The samples in this section list changes for the VTAM address space.<br><br>
        <b>A01APPLS(CNMS0013)</b><br>
        This member contains the application (APPL) major no descoded for the NetView program.<br>
        If you did not real locate and recopy the VTAMLST datasets, make the following changes to A01APPLS:<br>
        •	Either set the domainID (system variable & CNMDOMN) in SYS1. PARMLIB member IEASYM xx or change<br>
        every occurrence of & CNMDOMN. in A01APPLS (CNMS0013) to the current domainID.<br>
        •	If you are not using the status monitor preprocessor, you can replace the APPL statements defining tasks for multiple concurrent NetView operators with one APPL statement using wild card characters (??), forexample:<br>
        •	If you are not using the status monitor preprocessor, you can replace the TAFAPPL statements with one APPL statement using wild card characters (??) following the LUname, forexample:<br><br>
        <img src="img4.jpeg"><br>
         
        APPL names defined for use by other applications (such as TAF) must not be defined with the samenaming scheme as terminal logon APPLs (for example, the domain name followed by a 3-charactersuffix). Doing so can cause these application names to be used by the NetView program for terminal logons, which can make the application name sun available for the purpose for which they were defined.<br>
      <br> <b> CNMNET(CNMSJ008)</b><br>
        CNMNET (CNMSJ008) is the start procedure for the VTAM program. Change CNMNET in your PROCLIB in the following way:<br>
        1.	For NetView data setsensure your high- level qualifier for system datasets points to NETVIEW. V6R3M0.

                The samples in this section list changes for the NetView address space.<br><br>
               <b> AAUPRMLP</b><br>
                The AAUPRMLP member in the DSIPARM data set contains initialization statements for the session monitor. It includes logic to extract initialization values from the CNMSTYL Emember. Use the V6R3 copy of the AAUPRMLP member, and update the NLDM statements in the CNMSTUSR or CxxSTGEN member to reflect the values previously specified in the AAUPRMLP member. Do not modify the version of the AAUPRMLP member that is included with the NetView product.<br><br>
                
                <b>BNJMBDST</b><br>
                If you made changes to the BNJMBDST hard ware monitor initialization member, migrate the changes to the CNMSTUSR or Cxx STGEN member. Most BNJMBDST statements have as sociated statements in the CNMSTYLE member (for example, NPDA. DSRBO or NPDA. ALERTFWD).<br><br>
                BNJMBDST statements that apply to DST members (for example XITCI) have no as sociated CNM STYLE statements. In this case, add these statements to the Data REXX version of the BNJMBDST member.<br>
                Make sure that you enclose the statements in quotation marks so that the REXX program can return them as NetView data lines rather than interpreting them as REXX statements.<br><br>
                <b>CNMEALUS</b><br>
                The CNMEALU SREXXEXEC sample is enhanced. This sample provides example son how to add user data to alert information and pass the alert information to either the alert adapter or the confirmed alert adapter of Event/ Automation Service.<br><br>
                
                <b>CNMEMSUS</b><br>
                The CNMEMSUS REXXEXEC sample is enhanced. This sample provides example son how to add user data to message information and pass the message information to either the message adapter or the confirmed message adapter of Event/ Automation Service.<br><br>
                 <b>CNMPROC (CNMSJ009)</b><br>
                CNMPROC (CNMSJ009) is the start procedure for the NetView program. Make the following changes to CNMPROC in your PROCLIB:<br>
                1.	For NetView datasets ensureyour high-level qualifier for user- defined datasets points to NETVIEW. V6R3USER.<br>
                2.	For NetView datasets ensure your high-level qualifier for system datasets points to NETVIEW. V6R3M0.<br>
                3.	Because the AONVSAM datasets have increased insize, real locate them during migration. Formore information aboutal locating VSAM datasets, refer to IBMZ NetView Installation: Getting Started. Also note that the VSAM cluster name prefixes have changed to NETVIEW. & domain.<br>
                4.	Add the following TQ1 statement after the VQ1 statement to specify the high-level qualifier of your NetView sequential datasets:<br>
                <img src="img5.jpeg">
                This statement does not affect the dynamical location of the sequential datasets used by the archive Can zlog function.<br>

                1.For the SECOPTS. CMDAUTH statement, the NetView program supports the SCOPE option in migration mode only. If you currently use scope of commands security definitions (CMDCLASS, KEYCLASS, VALCLASS statements in DSICMD, with matching OP CLASS statements), you can convert them in to equivalent command authorization table statements using the SECMIGR command.If you initialize the NetView program using the SCOPE option, the SECMIGR command is used to convert existing scope security definitions. The converted table is written to the first DSIPARM dataset and is put in to effect.<br>

               <b> DSICMD</b><br>
                The command definition statements in the DSICMD member were replaced by new command definitionsin the CNMCMD member.

                If you do not convert your definitions in the DSICMDU member to the new format before NetView initialization, information contained in the DSICMDU member is converted and stored in a NetView KEEP under the PPT for 2 hours. During this time, you can use a NetView PIPE command to retrieve theseconverted command definitions.The following example shows one way of retrieving these definitions for display:<br>
                <h6>/PPT:PIPEKEEPDSICMDU|CONS</h6><br>

The DSITBL01 automation table provides basic automation statements to respond to messages and management services units (MSUs). If the DSITBL01 automation table is not activated during NetView initialization, the DWO093W warning message is issued by the NetView program.<br><br>
                Some % INCLUDE statements and as sociated statements to start automation were replaced by entries in the CNMSTYLE member. If you modified the DSITBL01 member, merge your changes with the V6R3DSITBL01 member. After making changes, renumber the NetView automation table. When the NetView automation table processes a message and finds a match that results in a command or command listbeing run, it writes the CNM493I message to the NetView log file. The CNM493I message contains the line number of the automation table entry matched.<br><br>
                Several messages that are supplied with the NetView product are changed with the V6R3 program.These messages are listed in the appendixes. Review the list and make any necessary changes to your automation table.<br><br>
                You can add your own automation table by using the AUTOCMD statement in the CNMSTUSR or CxxSTGEN member. Place your automation table before the DSITBL01 automation table and code CONTINUE(YES) on any local customization to make sure that messages flow to the DSITBL01 automation table.

                <b>IPManagement</b><br>
                Most of the IP management functions that are available under the AON TCP subtower have also beenmade available under either the base NetView program (for example, Ping and Tracerte) or the new IP Management (IPMGT) tower. This change no longer requires you to configure the AON component inorder to access these IP management functions. However, because the AON TCP subtower and the IPMGT tower are mutually exclusive, you must decide whether to use the IPMGT tower or the AON TCP sub tower in order touse these IP management functions. To help with this decision, review the following list of IP management functions that are not available under either the base NetView program or the IPMGT tower:<br>
                •	IPservermanagement(forUNIXCommandServerandTSOCommandServer)<br>

                Starting with NetView for z /OSV6R1, a new logging facility named Can zlog is required to be present for successful automation of system messages. This facility is enabled by using a data space which is, by default, defined with 2GB of virtual storage, and is allocated to the Master Scheduler address space. For more information about defining this data space, see the Installation: Getting Started manual.<br>
                Warning: Proper planning for real and auxiliary storage must be performed before enabling the Can zlog data space,as system slow down and hangs can occur with in sufficient storage.<br>
               <b> NetViewResourceManager</b><br>
                As a result of beingable to customize the NetView Resource Managerau to task, forwarding status from ahost at the V5R2 or later level to a manager host on a previous release works only if the NetView Resource Managerau to task is AUTONRM. However, you can continue to forward status from ahostat the V1R4 level to a manager at the V5R2 or later level. There is no restriction on the NetView Resource Managerau to task name in V5R2or later for the upward migration to work.<br>
                <b>Security Enhancements</b><br>
                The following security enhancements have been made:<br>

                •	User-defined command authorization table:<br>
                With NetView V6.2.1 APAR OA48179, a sample command authorization table named CNMSCATU is provided in the DSIPARM data set. This sample is included by DSIPARM member CNMSCAT2 and is intended for user command authorization table entries. When using CNMSCATU, review and make any necessary modifications to CNMSCAT2, while considering the following rules:<br>
                –	If you have more than one PROTECT statement that describes the same command, keyword and value, the first statement is used and all others are ignored.<br>
                –	More than one PERMIT statement can be specified for the same comman did entifier.<br>

            <b>PasswordPhrases</b><br>
            The NetView program provides support for password phrase authorization. A password phrase can beused as a substitute for a password for all NetView functions that usean SAF product, such as RACF,for security checking. Any panel that accepts passwords was updated to accept password phrases. The password phrase can include phrases from 9-100 characters in length.<br>
            The RACF product allows password phrases to contain any valid EBCDIC characters. When setting apassword phrase for a user ID that will be accessed from a non-z/OS system, the password on that system is enteredas ASCII text. Not all EBCDIC characters havean ASCII equivalent, so limit the EBCDIC password phrase to characters that havean ASCII equivalent.<br>
            Password phrases are not supported in the following environments:<br>
            •	Password checking using the DSIOPF member<br>
            •	Log on validation using the DSIEX12 installation exit<br>
            •	Tivoli Enterprise Portal login. Because of this restriction, the password phrase cannot be passed to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server for RACF verification.<br>
            •	Functions that use the NetView-NetView task (NNT)<br><br>
